This repository collects and backsup python notebooks that I have worked on through the Jupyter Lab environment connected through the Ocean Observatories Initiative
In collaboration with Dr. Dax Soule at the SEES department of Queens College, CUNY.
As of September 17th 2025: Have a successful code portraying TMPSF data from the ASHS-MJ03B thermistor array programable to interpret data across all time frames available within the database.
Currently trying to rework the code to fit the ASHS-MJ03B BOTPT sensor. Goal is to get a working graph comparing Temperature with X-Y tilt data over time.
